LuaLDAP
(https://github.com/bdellegrazie/lualdap/)

LuaLDAP is a simple interface from Lua to an LDAP client, in fact it is a bind to
OpenLDAP or to ADSI. It enables a Lua program to:

    * Connect to an LDAP server;
    * Execute any operation (search, add, compare, delete, modify and rename);
    * Retrieve entries and references of the search result.

LuaLDAP is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.1.

Current version is 1.2.2. It was developed for both Lua 5.1 and Lua 5.2,
and both OpenLDAP 2.1 or newer and ADSI.
